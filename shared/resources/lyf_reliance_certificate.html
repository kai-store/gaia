and updates and enhancements to any software previously installed
(including entirely new versions), (collectively &quot;Update&quot;)
after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software to
improve the Software and ultimately enhance your user experience with
your device. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update
that Reliance may provide to you or make available to you after the
date you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide
other terms along with such Update. To use Software provided through
Update, you must first be licensed for the Software identified by
Reliance as eligible for the Update. After the Update, you may no
longer use the Software that formed the basis for your eligibility.
The updated Software version may add new functions and, in some
limited cases, may delete existing functions. While the Update will
be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the Software
updates will only be offered by your network carrier, and such
Software updates will be governed by your contractual relationship
with your network carrier. With the &quot;Automatic Update&quot;
function enabled (as in the default setting in the System Updates
menu in the Settings), your device downloads some Updates
automatically from time to time. Downloading via cellular network may
result in additional charges. Your device will, however, ask for your
consent before installing any Update If you choose to disable the
&quot;Automatic Update&quot; function, and then you can check the
availability of new Updates by clicking on the &quot;Check for
updates&quot; menu in the Settings. We recommend that you check
availability of any new updates periodically for optimal use of your
device. If you want to avoid any use of network data for the Update
downloads, then you should choose the &quot;Wi-Fi Only&quot; option
in the Setting. </font></font>
